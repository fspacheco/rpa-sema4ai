# Installing and Using Sema4.ai in VS Code

To use Sema4.ai (previously Robocorp), you need Python. Besides that, it is recommended to use an IDE, and VS Code is a good option, with extensions for Python and Sema4.ai.

## Installation

The instructions for installing Python in VS Code are from [VSCode quick start].(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-quick-start)

### 1 VS Code

Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com. The basic layout of VS Code is explained in the [documentation].(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_basic-layout)

It will ask you to create a folder for your workspace. This is the place where you will save your project.

### 2 Python

Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

For Windows, add Python to the *path*.

And disable the path length limit.

### 3 VS Code Python extension

Install the Python extension from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

After that, you should be able to see three extensions related to Python installed in VS Code.

### 4 Sema4.ai extension

Inside VS Code, search for the extension and install it.

If you click in the *S4* icon on the left, you will see that the extension is installed.

## Creating a task from a template

As mentioned in the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), "the most important key combination to know is **Ctrl+Shift+P**, which brings up the Command Palette. From here, you have access to all functionality within VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations."

Use Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette and search for *sema4.ai: create task package*.

Then, choose the template *Python minimal*.

![](img/getting-started/sema4-template-python-minimal.png)

And use the workspace folder.

![](img/getting-started/sema4-workspace.png)

After this process, you will get a list of files for your automation project.

![](img/getting-started/sema4-project-files.png)

Open the file *tasks.py*. The minimal task simply creates a variable and assigns some text to it.

![](img/getting-started/sema4-minimal-task.png)

It will take some time to download all the packages that are needed (in the lower right of the screen you can follow the progress).

![](img/getting-started/sema4-creating-task.png)

To run the project, you can use:
- the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and *Sema4.ai: Run Task Package*
- **or** the icon *S4* on the left and :arrow_forward: *Run task*

![](img/getting-started/sema4-run-task.png)
![](img/getting-started/sema4-run-taks-icon.png)

You will see many messages in the terminal and finally *status: PASS* and *OK*.

![](img/getting-started/sema4-output.png)

You can click on the *log.html* file to open it in the browser.

![](img/getting-started/sema4-log.png)

You can follow all the steps of the task in the log. In this example, it was simple: you see the variable `message` being created and modified.

## Adding a new task

Let's reproduce the task you created with UIPath, but now using Python and Sema4.ai:
- create a bot to open the webpage of HAMK's library in https://hamk.finna.fi/
- search for one keyword of your choice
- take a screenshot of the results

We are automating a browser, so you need to include this *import*
```python
from robocorp import browser
```

You can learn about all the functions in this module from [robocorp-browser documentation](https://sema4.ai/docs/automation/python/robocorp/robocorp-browser).

Now, define a new task to open the browser, fill the search bar and click the search icon.

```python
@task
def open_page():
    page = browser.goto("https://hamk.finna.fi/")
    page.locator("#searchForm_lookfor").fill("robotics")
    page.locator(".btn-primary > .fi-basic-search").click()
    browser.screenshot()
```
There are different options for the locators. If you inspect the page, you will find that the search form has a name, an id, a placeholder, and a label text.

```
page.getByLabel('Search terms')
page.getByRole('searchbox', { name: 'Search terms' })
page.getByPlaceholder('Findâ€¦')
page.locator('input[name="lookfor"]')
```

I chose the `id` because it is reliable in both languages (Suomi/English). Check it.

After running the task, the log file shows the screenshot. You can click to open it.

## Additional information

### Pressing enter

Instead of the instruction to click the mouse, you can use a instruction to press enter in the keyboard. Sema4.ai (Robocorp) uses Playwright for browser automation. The full set of available keys is in [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-keyboard#keyboard-press).

```python
    page.keyboard.press("Enter")
```

### Finding locators

How to know the names of locators? There is a point-and-click tool in *S4* menu that helps you.
